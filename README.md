This is a dice game challenge created using html5, css3 and Javascript.

You need to click on the 'Play Me' button continuously to play the game.

I have also implemented the score part for both the players.

I have also included validation for user name input.

I have developed this small game during my web development course taken by Angela ma'am in udemy platform.

Hope you will like it. 😀

Please don't hesitate to modify my code and optimize it more. 👍
